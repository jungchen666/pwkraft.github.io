  <hr>

  <p>
  I am a PhD Candidate in the <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/" target="blank">Department of Political Science</a> at Stony Brook University. My research focuses on the psychological underpinnings of political attitudes, behavior, and reasoning. I am especially interested in the development and application of new statistical methods in the area of political psychology. In my dissertation, I use quantitative text analysis to study how citizens discuss and justify their political preferences and beliefs in open-ended survey responses as well as experiments involving group discussions.
