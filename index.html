  <h2 class="post-title">Welcome</h2>

  <hr>

  <p>
  I am a PhD Candidate in the <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/" target="blank">Department of Political Science</a> at Stony Brook University. My research focuses on the psychological underpinnings of political attitudes, reasoning, and behavior. I am especially interested in the development and application of new statistical methods in the area of political psychology. In my dissertation, I use quantitative text analysis to study how citizens discuss and justify their political preferences and beliefs in open-ended survey responses as well as online discussions. In August 2018, I will join the <a href="https://uwm.edu/political-science/" target="blank">Department of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a> as an assistant professor.

  Outside of academia, I enjoy cycling, hiking, climbing, and photography. I am also a fan of the German card game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_%28card_game%29">Skat</a>. Here's a little <a href="http://pwkraft.shinyapps.io/Skat">Shiny app</a> that keeps track of our group's game statistics.
